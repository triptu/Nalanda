For scraping the new notifications the best way in my opinion is to open the general announcements link.
All the notices etc. are there only. 
Each notice is of the form-
http://nalanda.bits-pilani.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8806

With id no. in the last starting from 8806 for this sem. Each notice have their unique id number.
Store the ids or the uppermost notice's id.
And go through the notices in sequential order for checking. Scrape notices till you hit the saved id no or you reach the end. These are new notifications. Save them.
Corner case :- If only one id is saved, it may happed that the corresponding notice is deleted.

How will it work:- The backend can check for new notices every five minute or so. For showing the app use laptop as backend server because any hosting service will require money to scrape from nalanda. Check out your AWS student pack. Maybe you will get something there.

When ever backend finds something, new  file upload or notification it notifes the frontend app via GET or POST requests.


Additional feature: -The user can choose to not show notifications for certain kinds of notices like tut section cancellation. 
Extra additional deature :- Only show notices perating to user's section and genral announcements. 


There is also a notice section. Go through that too.


Working plan:-

1. Make a scraper for general notice and announcements section which can save the notices in .txt file in laptop in corresponding subjects in a new notices folder.
2. If a notice has associated file in it, download it in same notices folder.
